# Movie Tracker

## Descriptions:

This is a Web application that allows the user to view the best movie of every genre and have the ability to save their favorite movies to view the information later. Not only can the user can view the genres but they can see if movies are in theater or movies that are coming out soon. On every movie information page we display the user reviewed score along with a description of the movie and an embedded youtube video of the trailer.

This application also has the ability to save and create user accounts. The favoriting functionality is only available to users who are signed in who have created an account.

## Future Development and Extensions Notes:

Future Development and Extensions would include hover activation states that show the trailer/ movie snippet. Another goal would be to make the all genres page replicate the UX/UI style of Netflix with their movie previewing experience. Additionally we would want to make the Movie Info page much more robust and replicate the IMDB page as an example. That would be to show what actors/directors were apart of the movie as well as user scores and reviews.
